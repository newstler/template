## Verify Information
Always verify information before presenting it. Do not make assumptions or speculate without clear evidence.

## File-by-File Changes
Make changes file by file and give me a chance to spot mistakes.

## Reasonably Sized Changes
If a request the user makes can end up affecting many (more than 5) files, always propose changes gradually.
That means you will implement the changes on a select number of files, then ask the user to confirm this is his intent, and only then proceed with the rest of the changes.

## No Apologies
Never use apologies.

## No Understanding Feedback
Avoid giving feedback about understanding in comments or documentation.

## No Whitespace Suggestions
Don't suggest whitespace changes.

## Always Summarize
Always summarize changes made.

## No Inventions
- Don't invent changes other than what's explicitly requested, except for where the "boy scout" principle applies, which is improving *related* code.
- Do not implement documentation files, example files, test files or other additions, without explicitly asking if the user wants them.

## No Unnecessary Confirmations
Don't ask for confirmation of information already provided in the context.

## Preserve Existing Code
Don't remove unrelated code or functionalities. Pay attention to preserving existing structures.

## No Implementation Checks
Don't ask the user to verify implementations that are visible in the provided context.

## No Unnecessary Updates
Don't suggest updates or changes to files when there are no actual modifications needed.

## Provide Real File Links
Always provide links to the real files, not x.md.

## No Current Implementation
Don't show or discuss the current implementation unless specifically requested.
